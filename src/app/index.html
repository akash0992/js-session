    <h3>Welcome all. Let's <em>play with</em> JavaScript</h3>
    <hr>

    <h3>DataTypes in JavaScript</h3>
    <p>
        There are <em>primitive</em> and <em>derived</em> data types in any language.
        Primitives have native support. By native we mean they are inherently supported
        at the lowest level - assembly code through memory registers etc - by the runtime enviroment - JS engine in browser or Node on server.
        Derived are the ones built on top of primitives - like custom types, domain types etc.
        You all create custom types without realizing.


        <section>
            <h4>Primitives</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>null</li>
                <li>undefined</li>
                <li>boolean</li>
                <li>number</li>
                <li>string</li>
                <li>symbol - ES6 onwards</li>
            </ul>

            We have wrapper objects for these primitives
            <ul>
                <li>Boolean</li>
                <li>Number</li>
                <li>String</li>
                <li>Symbol</li>
            </ul>

            Each wrapper has <em>valueOf()</em> <del>function</del> <ins>method</ins> that return
            primitive values

            All primitives are <strong>immutable</strong>(their value cannot be changed)

        <section>
            <h4>Derived</h4>
            <strong>Object</strong> is the root derived type in JavaScript. Other objects that derive from
            Object are :
            <ul>
                <li>Date</li>
                <li>Array</li>
                <li>Math</li>
                <li>RegExp</li>
                <li>Error</li>
                <li>Functions - yes, <em>function</em>s : These are regular objects with the additional
                    capability of being callable</li>
                <li>Promise - ES6 onwards</li>
                <li> ... and many more</li>
            </ul>

            When we create an object by any means - {}, new Object - what is create is called a type.
            This type derives from <strong>Object</strong> and is the basic building block of our domain.
